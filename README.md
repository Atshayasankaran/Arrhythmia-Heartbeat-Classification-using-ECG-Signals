# Arrhythmia-Heartbeat-Classification-using-ECG-Signals
An arrhythmia is a disorder where the heart beats out of its usual rhythm. It means the heart beats irregularly.
The rate of a personâ€™s heartbeat is determined by electrical signals flowing through the heart. These signals
are produced by the Sino Atrial (SA) node in the heart which acts as a natural pacemaker. If these electrical
signals are irregular, it leads to heart problem. In recent years, the individuals who are diagnosed with this
condition has increased. In this work hybrid model is created for feature extraction and classification of various arrhythmias which includes Nonectopic beats (normal beat), Ventricular ectopic beats, Supraventricular ectopic beats, Fusion Beats and Unknown Beats by comparing various algorithms for feature extraction, feature reduction and classification. 

# Dataset description
In this study, Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel
Hospital (MIT-BIH) Arrhythmia Dataset [20] is used. Dataset contains
the ECG signals taken from 47 persons recorded for 24 h. This data
set contains ECG signals of subjects aged between 23 and 89 and
also contain 53% male and 47% female cardio signals.

# Preprocessing
1)	Denoising is performed to minimize the noise or unwanted data
from the ECG signal. For denoising Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
is used.

2)	The dataset contains the ECG signal with continuous beats. Segmentation is
used to separate a single beat from the continuous beats.

3)	Resampling is the process of balancing an unbalanced dataset. The
dataset has a varied amount of data for each class.

| Classes      | No of Samples |
|--------------|---------------|
|Normal        | 75011         |
|SVE           | 2546          |
|VEB           | 7129          |
|Fusion        | 802           |
|Unknown       | 982           |

When compared to the class with the most instances, the number of instances of the class with the fewest instances is less than one percent. To balance the dataset, resampling is performed. After sampling, each class contains 5000 samples.
